Adsorption Equilibria Rules
===========================
For gases and their mixtures, the rules,
limits, and consistency tests are :cite:`Talu1988`

#.  Unary isotherms should reduce to Henry's law at the limit of zero pressure.

#.  In spite of incorrect limits at zero pressure,
    both the Toth and DR equations are accurate
    for calculating spreading pressure provided the pressure is sufficiently high.

#.  At fixed temperature and pressure, thermodynamically consistent :math:`x`-:math:`y`
    diagrams intersect each other at least once.
    This can be derived by considering the Gibbs adsorption isotherm at constant
    spreading pressure.


#.  Mixed gas isotherms should display continuity with single-gas isotherms.
    That is,

    .. math::
        \lim_{y_i\to 1} q_\text{t} = q_i \;(\text{constant}\; P, T)

    where :math:`q_\text{t}=\sum_iq_i` is the total loading.
    Discontinuities generate inaccurate values of adsorbate vapor pressure
    that lower the quality of calculations of mixed-gas adsorption.

#.  Isothermal selectivity curves for different vapor compositions
    should intersect at the limit of zero pressure.

#.  Activity coefficients in the adsorbed phase are functions
    of spreading pressure as well as composition.

#.  Imperfections in the gas phase led to corrections in fugacity that are small
    compared to the effect of nonidealities in the adsorbed phase.
    In most cases, vapor-phase imperfections may be ignored unless the pressure
    is above 500 kPa and experimental error is less than a few percent.
