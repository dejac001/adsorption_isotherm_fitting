Fit temperature-dependent isotherms to equilibrium data.

# Getting Started

[Documentation](https://adsorption-isotherm-fitting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Examples
========

H2S/CH4 on MFI Zeolite
----------------------

Fit temperature-dependent Langmuir unary and binary isotherms for H2S/CH4 mixture isotherms.
Data for fitting taken from [Shah et al, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b03015).
